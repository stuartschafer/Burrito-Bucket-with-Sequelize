# Burrito-Bucket-with-Sequelize
A full-stack app for managing your life's dreams, goals, and accomplishments. Uses sequelize to connect with a MySQL database.

Working on all of your dreams, aspirations, and goals in life can be tough to remember.
Burrito Bucket will help keep track of all of them.

You can add new dreams/goals to your bucket, and select a timeframe for each.

Once you have accomplished something, you can mark it as completed by clicking "Did It" next to it.

Everything is stored in a database, so no matter when/where you are, you can always check in on your progress, add new items, or mark items as complete.
